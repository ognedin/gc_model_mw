Catalog of model globular clusters in the Milky Way

This is a mock catalog of Galactic globular clusters calculated with a model for the formation and evolution of globular cluster systems. Current version of the model published in Chen & Gnedin (2022). It is based on earlier versions developed in Muratov & Gnedin (2010), Li & Gnedin (2014), Choksi et al. 2018, Choksi & Gnedin 2019a, Choksi & Gnedin 2019b.

The model matches the observed mass function and age-metallicity distribution of the Galactic globular clusters. Current version of the model adds information on the spatial and kinematic distributions of the globular cluster system, based on tagging particles from the Illustris TNG50 simulation. It matches the observed surface number density profile and the velocity dispersion profile of the Galactic globular clusters.

The catalog of clusters survived to redshift z=0 provides information on cluster age, mass at formation and at z=0, Cartesian coordinates and velocities at z=0, orbital actions in the best-fitting halo+disk Galactic potential, apocenter and pericenter radii, value of the potential, cluster iron metallicity, total and stellar mass of host galaxy at formation, and total and stellar mass of host galaxy at z=0. The catalog also contains a tag origin to mark clusters formed in the central halo (in-situ) and in satellite galaxies (ex-situ), and gives the time of accretion for ex-situ clusters.

The catalog of disrupted clusters contains also the time of disruption. The coordinates and other orbital information is for the center of mass of the resulting stellar stream.

Both catalogs contain GC systems of 3 halos most resembling the Milky Way in their growth of dark matter and stellar mass. Each halo provides an alternative possible history of the assembly of the MW system of globular clusters. GC systems can be analyzed combined for all 3 halos, or for each halo separately. The adjustable model parameters are tuned to match the MW system and are slightly different from the version published in Chen & Gnedin (2022).
